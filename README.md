When Accessing this website's home screen you should be greeted with the following screens: 
Home, About Us, Shop, Delivery, Fan Page, Charties/Affilations, Bot Commands, Buisness Inquiries, Cart, Sign In

When Accessing the Shop Page you should be able to do the following: 
Add items to cart, remove items from cart, pay for items in cart, gain points for each purchase, display shop level

When accessing sign in page: Your patronage level should be displayed as well as accumulated "currency". 
Currency should be just accumulated over time and provide .10C off future purchases per 100Â£/$ spent.

The home screen should clearly display the site logo and concept art for the channel. 

Buisness Inquiries should display ways to contact me, any other website owners, or to apply for open positions. 

The Fan Page is for displaying fan art made by artists, reviews, or whatever. 

The Charties/Affiliations page is for showing off anything that we personally believe in. 

Commands are for bot commands which will hopefully end up seamless across both Twitch and Discord*.
